My name is Phoon Kah Chi with matrix number, WIC180056. I am majoring in Computer System and Networking. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this subject. This is because I love DS. 
I acquired A+ for my previous Programming 1 course. It's not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get A+ for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will work hard. Wish me luck!!!

It’s me again. Finally, it’s the end of the term and the DS class has finished! I think I did XXX (your performance) in this course.
